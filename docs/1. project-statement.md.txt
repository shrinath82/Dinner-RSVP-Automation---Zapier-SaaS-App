Project Statement - Dinner RSVP Automation:
Create a Zapier Interfaces Form asking people to RSVP for a dinner that youâ€™re hosting. 
For anyone that says yes, please send them an email letting them know further details, and then set up a reminder email that is sent to them 1 day before the event. 
For everyone that responds no, please send them an email thanking them for filling out the form. 
This should be done in one Zap


1. Project Overview
This project automates the RSVP process using Zapier. It collects responses through a form and sends personalized emails based on the user's response.

2. Problem Statement
Manually managing RSVPs for an event is time-consuming. This solution automates:

RSVP collection.
Confirmation emails for attendees.
Thank-you emails for non-attendees.
Reminder emails for attendees before the event.

3. Solution Approach
A Zapier Interfaces form collects RSVP responses.
A Zap (automation) processes form submissions and triggers email actions.
The system sends confirmation/reminder emails for attendees and thank-you emails for non-attendees.
