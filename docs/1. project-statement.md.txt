Project Statement - Dinner RSVP Automation:
Create a Zapier Interfaces Form asking people to RSVP for a dinner that youâ€™re hosting. 
For anyone that says yes, please send them an email letting them know further details, and then set up a reminder email that is sent to them 1 day before the event. 
For everyone that responds no, please send them an email thanking them for filling out the form. 
This should be done in one Zap
