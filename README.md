1. Overview:
   This project automates the RSVP process using Zapier. It collects responses through a form and sends personalized emails based on the user's response.

2. Problem Statement: Manually managing RSVPs for an event is time-consuming.
   This solution automates:
   . RSVP collection.
   . Confirmation emails for attendees.
   . Thank-you emails for non-attendees.
   . Reminder emails for attendees before the event.

3. Solution Approach
   A Zapier Interfaces form collects RSVP responses.
   A Zap (automation) processes form submissions and triggers email actions.
   The system sends confirmation/reminder emails for attendees and thank-you emails for non-attendees.

4. Tech Stack
